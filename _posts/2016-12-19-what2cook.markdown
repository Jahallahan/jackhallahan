        After a successful pilot, the team at What2Cook approached GO1 to rebuild the site with more advanced functionality and a new look-and-feel.
        </p>

        <p>
        The platform helps busy families plan, shop and cook healthy and easy meals. It provides tools for every stage – a weekly customisable meal plan, interactive shopping lists and easy-to-cook recipes.
        </p>

        <p>
        I was the lead designer working on this project. I approached the design mobile-first, as the experience had to transition seamlessly between a family's devices, especially mobiles and tablets.
